									<p>
										It started with an old Lord of the Rings RTS game and wanting so badly to insert my own creative changes into the game. 
										After searching hours for game mods made by others I thought, “if others have done it, why not me?” And that is just what I did. 
										I dove straight into the code and, though I got lost several times, I made my first new character in the game. A sense of achievement washed 
										over me and I knew I wanted more. Several characters and a college degree later, I still feel satsfied when a project is completed.

									<p> There is something about building and creating; watching all the pieces fall into place with a sense of pride in seeing hours of work come to life. 
										Whether it’s organizing and tinkering with spreadsheet data or thinking of new ways to improve an app I just built, 
										I can’t help getting immersed in the process. Every new or revised project is a chance to learn and there you will find me deep in the middle of it.

									<h3>Sample Projects</h3>
									<p> I've made a hobby of creating small projects and exploring programming toolsets. As much as I like reading about and researching technologies, 
										I find that using what I learned solidifies my knowledge of it. The projects below are a sample of some of things I recently learned and have put to use.

												<h4>An Algorithm App</h4>
												<p>This app consists of a simple UI that allows users

												<h4>More to Come</h4>
												<p>I am always excited to learn new things and tinker with various technologies. 
													One of my favorite hobbies is experimenting with Google Sheets. I have several workbooks 
													that perform scripts, queries, and dynamic data manipulations. I plan to add these and other projects some time in the near future.

									<h3>Not Just Programming</h3>
									<p>My interests are not in programming alone. I enjoy working with other technologies 
										in the  computer science field as well. I studied computer hardware and software management, 
										earning a PC Pro Certification (seen below) for IT associates. I am currently researching and studying for the 
										CCNA Security certification in my free time.</p>

									<p> The IT field has so much to offer with exciting opportunities in many areas. I can see myself working in cyber security, as a network engineer, or a data analyst, just to name a few. 
										I am always up to the challenge of expanding my knowledge and honing my skills.</p>
